2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock CLK_PORT_MAP/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock CLK_PORT_MAP/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin CLK_PORT_MAP/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.501 ns between PWM_OUT/sine_idx_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0) and PWM_OUT/PWM_High_Tmp_reg_lopt_replica/D (clocked by clk_out1_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
